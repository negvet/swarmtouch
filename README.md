# SwarmTouch

An interaction strategy for a human-swarm communication, which combines impedance control and vibrotactile feedback. The  approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes drones formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors. Several tactile patterns representing static and dynamic parameters of the swarm are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at the fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex formation.

Take a look at the videos to get a better sense about the project:
